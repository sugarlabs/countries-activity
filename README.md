# Countries Activity #

Players have to type in a country for each letter of the alphabet. Successes are rewarded with the display of the country's flag. The activity 'knows' the English names of 212 countries.

This display is also available to players after successfully filling in every letter - just click on the globe or flag picture.

But there's even more - click on a flag in this display to get a world map with the country's capital marked.
